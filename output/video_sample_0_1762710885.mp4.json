  "content": "This project uses artificial intelligence to help detect cancer at an early stage which can be crucial for saving lives. The idea of the data that contains labre and medical images of cancer and non-cancerous cells. There are several data sets available online like the cancer image archive TCI that can help you with this. Once you have your data, the next step is to P-process it. For medical images, this might involve converting them into numerical arrays or normalizing them to ensure consistency. For the tech stack, you will be using a combination of Python and Deep Learning libraries. The most popular Deep Learning framework is TensorFlow or PyTorch. These libraries are great for building and trading machine learning models. You will also work with CNNs which are specifically designed for image recognition tasks like this one. CNNs analyze patterns in the medical images and then classify them as either cancerous or not. Now to handle the data, you can use pandas and numpy. You can also use flask or stream rate to create simple webbap for your algorithm. This way doctors can upload images and your AI system will analyze them and give predictions on whether the image shows signs of cancer or not.",
